  Erroneous requests:    When erroneous requests are sent to the API, a HTTP header will be sent
                         with the key "MediaWiki-API-Error" and then both the value of the
                         header and the error code sent back will be set to the same value
  
                         In the case of an invalid action being passed, these will have a value
                         of "unknown_action"
  
Parameters:
  version             - When showing help, include version for each module
  maxlag              - Maximum lag can be used when MediaWiki is installed on a database replicated cluster.
                        To save actions causing any more site replication lag, this parameter can make the client
                        wait until the replication lag is less than the specified value.
                        In case of a replag error, a HTTP 503 error is returned, with the message like
                        "Waiting for $host: $lag seconds lagged\n".
                        See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Maxlag_parameter for more information
